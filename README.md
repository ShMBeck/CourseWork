Software Design Document for The Gaming Room:

Summary:
    Draw It or Lose It, the game where teams will compete to guess what is being drawn, where they will use rendered stock drawings as clues. It was consist of four rounds of one minute each, with the drawing clues being fully complete at the 30-second mark. Each team will have a chance to offer a guess provided the first team fails to guess. Our client, The Gaming Room, requires our help to setup the environment for a web-based version of the game which is currently only available as an android application.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    I analyzed the clients requirements thoroughly and recommended software that I found would be best for their needs. I believe that this is one aspect that I did very well.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    Having the details of the document spelled out for me in a manner of speaking allowed me to easily decide what exactly I needed to code and how much more easily.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    I would work more on the design constraints, going more in-depth and in general just improving them to the clients specifications.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    I made sure to implement their needs through ensuring the software would be easy for the user to use. If the user's needs are not considered then the design of the software is destined to fail, no user, no software.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
    I approached it through a thought-out part by part method, constructing one piece at a time and slowly building on top of it. In the future I believe it would be best to add more OOP elements into my design.

Contact List:
Project Developed during the february of 2023.

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.:
    the project is that of a contact list, in essence a contact list is a list that works through "contacting" or linking multiple objects together through properties of each object. You could view it similarly to a family tree in the sense that a mother is linked to their son, and the son is linked to his wife and children, etc.

What did you do particularly well?:
    I am content with how well I did in making use of classes to reuse code rather than constantly repeating myself.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?:
    I could work on cleaning it up more and organizing it more than it already is, doing so would allow easier usage of the code and future modification, both by myself and others.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?:
    In terms of difficulty the most difficult was just the methods I had to implement to properly get the frequency of each product, it wasn't particularly hard, but it did take me longer than the rest to program.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?:
    The most transferable skill is my further development of my usage of classes, I am quite fond of classes but didn't have much experience with them in c++ until now.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?:
    I made sure to include a bunch of comments throughout the code to allow for others to understand it, as well as myself, and change it easier than it otherwise would be. I also made sure that each class would be easy to change and adapt by implementing as many methods as I can rather than rewriting code repeatedly in multiple place.

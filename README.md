Shane Beck, Student at SNHU for a Bachelors in Computer Science.
Project Developed during the february of 2023.

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.:
    the project is that of a contact list, in essence a contact list is a list that works through "contacting" or linking multiple objects together through properties of each object. You could view it similarly to a family tree in the sense that a mother is linked to their son, and the son is linked to his wife and children, etc.

What did you do particularly well?:
    I am content with how well I did in making use of classes to reuse code rather than constantly repeating myself.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?:
    I could work on cleaning it up more and organizing it more than it already is, doing so would allow easier usage of the code and future modification, both by myself and others.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?:
    In terms of difficulty the most difficult was just the methods I had to implement to properly get the frequency of each product, it wasn't particularly hard, but it did take me longer than the rest to program.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?:
    The most transferable skill is my further development of my usage of classes, I am quite fond of classes but didn't have much experience with them in c++ until now.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?:
    I made sure to include a bunch of comments throughout the code to allow for others to understand it, as well as myself, and change it easier than it otherwise would be. I also made sure that each class would be easy to change and adapt by implementing as many methods as I can rather than rewriting code repeatedly in multiple place.
